# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-04-01
### Added
- New keywords: `match`, `case`, `default`, `const`, `strata`, `tremor`, `catch`, `throw`.
- New operators: `<<`, `>>`, `%=`.
- Bitwise operator support in binary expressions (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`).
- New AST nodes for:
  - Pattern matching (`MatchStmt`, `MatchArm`)
  - Immutable variables (`ConstStmt`)
  - Enumerations (`StrataDecl`)
  - Error handling (`TremorStmt`, `ThrowStmt`)

### Changed
- Parser updated to recognise `strata`, `const`, `match/case/default`, `tremor/catch`, `throw`.
- Semantic analyser with stubs and basic validation for new constructs.
- Codegen stubs for new constructs and bitwise/shift expression support.
- Lexer and parser tests extended for new tokens and syntax.
- Release CI/CD improved for Linux/Windows/macOS with better LLVM detection.

### Fixed
- Windows workflow: no longer fails when a newer LLVM is already installed and a downgrade is attempted.
- Linux workflow: `LLVM_DIR` now set explicitly to avoid picking up an older LLVM on the runner.
- CMake: LLVM backend chosen by architecture (x86_64 vs arm64).
- Codegen: compatibility with LLVM 15/17+ for `Reloc::Model` (`llvm::Optional` vs `std::optional`).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-01
### Added
- Automated release pipeline with binaries for Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-01
### Changed
- README simplified for quick installation and usage.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-01
### Added
- First stable release of the OFS language (lexer, parser, semantic analysis, LLVM codegen, runtime, and examples).
